### Step 4: Update the Website

2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE` with your actual Web App URL from Step 3

### Step 5: Test the Integration
1. Open your website's contact page
2. Fill out and submit the contact form
3. Check your Google Sheet - you should see a new row with the form data
4. Check your email (Tyler's email) for a notification

## üìä Google Sheet Structure

The integration will automatically create these columns in your Google Sheet:
- **Timestamp**: When the form was submitted
- **Name**: Customer's name
- **Email**: Customer's email address
- **Phone**: Customer's phone number
- **Message**: Customer's message
- **IP Address**: Customer's IP (if available)
- **User Agent**: Customer's browser information

## üìß Email Notifications

The system will automatically send email notifications to `Blackshear.Tyler@gmail.com` when forms are submitted. The email includes:
- All form data
- Submission timestamp
- IP address (if available)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Form submissions not appearing in Google Sheet**
- Verify the Sheet ID is correct in `google-apps-script.js`
- Check that the Web App URL is correct in `contact-form.js`
- Ensure the Google Apps Script deployment has "Anyone" access

**2. "Google Apps Script URL not configured" error**
- Update the `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` in `contact-form.js` with your actual Web App URL

**3. Permission errors**
- Make sure you're logged into the same Google account that created the script
- Re-deploy the Web App if needed

**4. Email notifications not working**
- Check the email address in `google-apps-script.js`
- Verify Gmail permissions in Google Apps Script

### Testing the Setup:
1. Run the `testSetup()` function in Google Apps Script to verify everything works
2. Check the execution log for any errors
3. Test the contact form on your website

## üîí Security Notes

- The Web App is set to "Anyone" access, but it only accepts POST requests with form data
- No sensitive information is exposed
- All data is stored securely in your Google Sheet
- Email notifications go only to the configured email address
